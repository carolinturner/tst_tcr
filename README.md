# Scripts for TST_TCR paper

The scripts provided here were used for analyses and figure plotting for [TST TCR publication](link here once available).

There are three sub-directories:
`RNAseq` provides code for bulk RNA sequencing analyses, and to make Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1. The associated source data can be downloaded from [Array Express](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress), accession number E-MTAB-14687.
`TCRseq` provides code for bulk TCR sequencing analyses, as well as analysis of validation datasets, and to make Figures 2,3,5 and Supplementary Figures 2-6 and 8-11. The associated source data can be downloaded from [UCL's Research Data Repository](add here link to DOI 10.5522/04/28049606 once public) or provided supplementary tables.
`metaclones` provides code for Metaclonotypist and Gliph2 analyses, and to make Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S7. The associated source data can be downloaded from [UCL's Research Data Repository](add here link to DOI 10.5522/04/28049606 once public) or provided supplementary tables.
