# Scripts for TST_TCR paper

The scripts provided here were used for analyses and figure plotting for the TST TCR manuscript.

There are four sub-directories:
* `RNAseq` provides code for bulk RNA sequencing analyses, and to make Figure 1, Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 2. Upon peer-reviewed publication of the manuscripts, the associated source data can be downloaded from [Array Express](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress), accession number E-MTAB-14687.
* `TCRseq` provides code for bulk TCR sequencing analyses, as well as analysis of validation datasets, and to make Table 2, Figures 2,3,5 and Supplementary Figures 3-14. Upon time of peer-reviewed publication of the manuscript, the associated source data can be downloaded from [UCL's Research Data Repository](add here link to DOI 10.5522/04/28049606 once public).
* `metaclones` provides code for Metaclonotypist and GLIPH2 analyses, and to make Figure 4 and Table 3. 
* `cross_modality` provides code to make Supplementary Table 1 (correlation with TST induration) and Supplementary Figure 15 (comparison between participants with presumed recent vs remote Mtb exposure). These scripts use both RNAseq and TCRseq outputs.
